## Brief Description

The project implements an application similar to Spotify. Features
include management of audio files, data manipulation, creation, and
interaction with playlists and podcasts. Actions are simulated through
various commands, subsequently generating reports about user activities.
In this phase, the concept of premium or free users, monetization, 
notifications, and recommendations is introduced. Among other things,
a new addition is the inclusion of Design Patterns (in stage 3 of the project):
- `Singleton` in the `Admin` class;
- `Singleton` in the `MonetizationManager` class;
- `Build` in the `Song` class;
- `Observer` in the `ChangeSourceDelegate` class;
- `Observer` in the `ObserverNotifications` class;
